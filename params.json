{"name":"MSDK","tagline":"Mass Spectrometry Development Kit","body":"### What is MSDK?\r\n\r\nMSDK is a Java library of algorithms for processing mass spectrometry data. The goals of the library are to provide a flexible data model with Java interfaces for mass-spectrometry related objects (including raw spectra, processed data sets, identification results etc.) and to integrate the existing algorithms that are currently scattered around various Java-based graphical tools, such as\r\n* [Guineu](https://code.google.com/p/guineu/)\r\n* [JDAMP](http://software.iab.keio.ac.jp/jdamp/)\r\n* [MassCascade](https://bitbucket.org/sbeisken/masscascade/)\r\n* [mzMatch](http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net)\r\n* [MZmine](http://mzmine.sourceforge.net)\r\n* [OpenChrom](https://www.openchrom.net)\r\n* [Maui-VIA](http://bimsbstatic.mdc-berlin.de/kempa/software/kempaSoftware.html)\r\n* [ProteoSuite](https://code.google.com/p/proteo-suite/)\r\n* [SIRIUS](http://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/sirius2/)\r\n\r\n### Platform\r\n\r\nMSDK requires Java runtime (JRE) version 1.7 or newer.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nPlease use the [Github's statistics](https://github.com/msdk/msdk/graphs/contributors) to see who has contributed to this project so far.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nMSDK binaries and source codes are dual-licensed under either the terms of the [Eclipse Public License v1.0](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) as published by the Eclipse Foundation\r\n \r\n  or (per the licensee's choosing)\r\n \r\nunder the terms of the GNU [Lesser General Public License version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n### How to join this project\r\n\r\nPlease join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/msdk-devel).\r\n\r\n### Source codes\r\n\r\nMSDK source codes are available from our [Github repository](https://github.com/msdk/msdk).
