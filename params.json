{"name":"MSDK","tagline":"Mass Spectrometry Development Kit","body":"### ![Logo](images/msdk_logo.png) What is MSDK?\r\n\r\nMSDK is a Java library of algorithms for processing mass spectrometry data. The goals of the library are to provide a flexible data model with Java interfaces for mass-spectrometry related objects (including raw spectra, processed data sets, identification results etc.) and to integrate the existing algorithms that are currently scattered around various Java-based graphical tools, such as (in alphabetical order):\r\n* [Guineu](https://code.google.com/p/guineu/)\r\n* [JDAMP](http://software.iab.keio.ac.jp/jdamp/)\r\n* [Maltcms](http://maltcms.sourceforge.net)\r\n* [MassCascade](https://bitbucket.org/sbeisken/masscascade/)\r\n* [Mass-Up](http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/mass-up/)\r\n* [Maui-VIA](http://bimsbstatic.mdc-berlin.de/kempa/software/kempaSoftware.html)\r\n* [msInspect](http://proteomics.fhcrc.org/CPL/msinspect/index.html)\r\n* [mzMatch](http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net)\r\n* [MZmine](http://mzmine.github.io)\r\n* [OpenChrom](https://www.openchrom.net)\r\n* [ProteoSuite](https://code.google.com/p/proteo-suite/)\r\n* [SIRIUS](http://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/sirius2/)\r\n\r\n### Why do we need MSDK?\r\n\r\nWhile competition among various algorithms is beneficial for the progress of research, the absence of a common data model and development platform makes it difficult and laborious to evaluate the results and performance of different algorithms. MSDK addresses this issue for the Java platform, while other projects such as [OpenMS](http://open-ms.sourceforge.net) or [ProteoWizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net) address this issue in C/C++. The advantages of Java are its multi-platform nature and easy, rapid development in a higher-level language compared to C/C++.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### API\r\n\r\nPlease see the complete [MSDK API](http://msdk.github.io/api/).\r\n\r\n#### Maven artifacts\r\n\r\nMSDK jars are automatically deployed to Maven Central. In order to use MSDK, simply add the following dependency to your pom.xml:\r\n\r\n```\r\n <dependency>\r\n    <groupId>io.github.msdk</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>msdk-all</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.0.3</version>\r\n </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Java version\r\n\r\nMSDK requires Java runtime (JRE) version 1.7 or newer.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nMSDK binaries and source codes are dual-licensed under either the terms of the [Eclipse Public License v1.0](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html) as published by the Eclipse Foundation\r\n \r\n  or (per the licensee's choosing)\r\n \r\nunder the terms of the GNU [Lesser General Public License version 2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html) as published by the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nPlease use GitHub's [statistics](https://github.com/msdk/msdk/graphs/contributors) to see who has contributed to this project so far.
