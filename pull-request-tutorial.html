<p>
There are several steps you need to follow in order to contribute your code to MSDK. If you are not familiar with GitHub, this might seem cumbersome at first, but you will surely appreciate the power of this <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">workflow</a> later. Steps 1-3 only need to be performed once, when you make your first contribution.
</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/join">Create</a> a personal account on GitHub.</li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">Fork the MSDK repository</a>. Now you have created your own, personal copy of MSDK at GitHub.</li>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork">Clone</a> the newly forked git repository (https://github.com/<strong>YOUR-USERNAME</strong>/msdk.git) to your PC, either using the <em>git clone</em> command, or using your favorite <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Java_IDEs">IDE</a>. Now you have created a local copy of your own GitHub repository. This copy will contain the <em>master</em> branch.</li> 
<li>In your local, cloned repository, <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">create and check out a new branch</a> for the feature or change that you are planning to work on.</li>
<li>Perform your development on this new branch, and <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit">commit</a> your changes with meaningful commit messages (multiple commits are fine). Note that all commits happen only within your local git repository.</li>
<li>When you are finished, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/">push your branch</a> to your on-line repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>Go to the website of your repository on GitHub and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#initiating-the-pull-request">create a pull request</a> to the original MSDK repository's <em>master</em> branch. We will review your pull request and provide comments. You can update your code and push new commits into the same branch of your own GitHub repository. These commits will be automatically added to the pull request.</li>
<li>When everyone is happy, we will merge your pull request and you can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-unused-branches/">delete your branches</a>.</li>
<li>You can keep your local repository up-to-date with the MSDK development branch by <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/">adding</a> the official MSDK repository as a new <em>remote</em> repository and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/">fetching changes</a> from there.</li>
</ol>
